# Basic Meditation Timer

This is a basic meditation timer that uses a tibetan bell to gently start and end meditation sessions. It has an off canvas expanding sidebar that doesn't push the main content off-screen.

## Getting Started

In order to use this timer, open the index.html file in a browser. Make sure all the files and sub-directories for this project are in the same directory.
